  C                    F
A glass of wine in her hand
  C                          F
I knew she would meet her connection
       C                      F
At her feet was her footloose man

And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"
Sing it to me now...

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him

In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands
