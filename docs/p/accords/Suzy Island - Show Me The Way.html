      <pre style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.25rem">[Verse 1]
Dm              F
Always what you did
Dm              F
Always what you said
Dm             F            Am
Love is just a number going round your head
Dm              F
Yeah its just a game
Dm          F
Everythings okay
Dm             F          Am
Put it in your pocket for another rainy day
Dm              F
Always what you want and you
Dm            F
Always want a chance
Dm            F             Am
Never gave me nothing but a cold hard glance
Dm                      F
You're calling for some time
Dm                  F
If time is what you need
Dm            F               Am
Needed me for nothing but the air I breathe
[Chorus]
Gm
So show me the way
Gm
You may be delayed
Dm
How must I behave
F                               Gm
I'm so so so so sick of running away
Gm
Like a kid with a video game
Dm                           F
Spinning to the wheel of the words you say
Dm F Dm F Dm F Am
Dm F Dm F Dm F Am
[Verse 2]
Dm                 F
So tell me all the things
Dm             F
All the simple things
Dm             F                   Am
All the little things that make it hard to touch my skin now
Dm               F
Is this what you want
Dm              F
A feeling not a rush
Dm                F
A cold and simple push
              Am
That makes it hard for me to look now
Dm         F
I wanna be adored
Dm       F
Wanna be adored
Dm       F                   Am
Wanna be adored just like my father and my mother
    Dm             F
But I don't really mind
Dm           F
I just wanna lie
Dm            F
here with you tonight
Am
Forget about the trouble
[Chorus]
Gm
So show me the way
Gm
You may be delayed
Dm
How must I behave
F                               Gm
I'm so so so so sick of running away
Gm
Like a kid with a video game
Dm                           F
Spinning to the wheel of the words you say
Gm
So show me the way
Gm
You may be delayed
Dm
How must I behave
F                               Gm
I'm so so so so sick of running away
Gm
Like a kid with a video game
Dm                           F
Spinning to the wheel of the words you say
Gm Gm Dm F
Gm Gm Dm F
[Bridge]
Gm
You can call it what you want
Gm
Calling it forever would
Dm
Never be enough
F
You can call it what you want
Gm
If it's all been said and done
Gm
I've never been in love before
Dm
Nothing is enough
F
You can call it what you want
Gm
If it's all just in my head
Gm
Well then I like it better there
Dm
All the people talking
F
Till we wake up in the morning
Gm
Yeah maybe we can jump
Gm
Cause nothing is forever
Dm
And darling thats enough
F
Darling thats enough
[Chorus]
   Gm          Dm
So show me the way
    Gm       Dm
You may be delayed
    Gm        Dm
How must I behave
    F                           Gm
I'm so so so so sick of running away
       Dm          Gm    Dm
Like a kid witha a video game
Gm              Dm           F
Spinning to the wheel of the words you say
   Gm          Dm
So show me the way
    Gm       Dm
You may be delayed
    Gm        Dm
How must I behave
    F                           Gm
I'm so so so so sick of running away
       Dm         Gm    Dm
Like a kid with a video game
Gm              Dm           F
Spinning to the wheel of the words you say
