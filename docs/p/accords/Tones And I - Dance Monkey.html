          E
Take your hand, my dear, and place them
           C#m
both in mine
              F#m
You know you stopped me dead when I was
           D

     F#m                              D
Oh I see you, see you, see you every time
          E                    C#m
And oh my I, I, I, I like your style
         F#m
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna

They say

Move for me
Move for me

Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my
     C#m
 eyes
             F#m
Just like a monkey I've been dancing my
         D
