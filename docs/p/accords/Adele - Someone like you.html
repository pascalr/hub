CAPO: II

[Intro]
G Bm Em C

[Verse 1]
G                   Bm
I heard that you're settled down
         Em                      C
That you found a girl and you're married now
G                 Bm
I heard that your dreams came true
          Em                       C
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
G                       Bm
Old friend, why are you so shy?
           Em                  C
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
  D                          Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
      C                 
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    D                           Em
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         C            
That for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
G                D                 Em  C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you two
         G         D           Em         C
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em    C
sometimes it hurts instead
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em    C
sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
    G            Bm
You know how the time flies
     Em                C
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
        G                    Bm
We were born and raised in a summer haze
      Em                     C
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
  D                          Em
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
      C                 
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
    D                       Em
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
         C            
That for me it isn't over

[Chorus]
G                D                 Em  C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you two
         G         D           Em         C
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em     C
sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

[Bridge]
D
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
  Em
Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made
C                              Am    G          C
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Chorus]
G                D                 Em  C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you...
         G         D           Em         C
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em    C
sometimes it hurts instead
[Chorus]
G                D                 Em  C
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       G               D        Em  C
I wish nothing but the best for you two
         G         D           Em         C
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em    C
sometimes it hurts instead
             G                 
Sometimes it lasts in love but
D                    Em    C
sometimes it hurts instead
