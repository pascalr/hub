Key: Am
[Intro]
F           Dm G     Am    Am/B     Am/C   Am/D Am
F           Dm G     Am       G   
[Verse 1]
    Am              Em
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you
            Am
And you are not me.
                        Em
The lengths that I will go to,
                     Am      Em
The distance in your eyes,
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.
[Chorus]
                 Am
That's me in the corner,
                 Em
That's me in the spotlight
            Am
Losing my religion.
          Em
Trying to keep up with you.
      Am                          Em
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
                G
I haven't said enough.
[Bridge]
  G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
  Dm             G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm   G   Am     G
I  think I thought I saw  you try.
[Verse 2]
          Am                   Em
Every whisper of every waking hour
                   Am
I'm choosing my confessions,
          Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
       Am                                 Em
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.
[Verse 3]
         Am
Consider this, consider this,
    Em
The hint of a century,
         Am
Consider this: the slip
     Em
That brought me to my knees failed.
Am
What if all these fantasies
     Em
Come    flailing around?
         Dm       G
Now I've said too much.
[Bridge]
    G                       F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
        Dm        G         Am   Am/B   Am/C   Am/D
I thought that I heard you sing.
Am   F               Dm  G   Am    G
I  think I thought I saw you try.

But that was just a dream,

That was just a dream.

Try, cry,   why,   try.
F                      Dm  G      Am            G
That was just a dream,    just a dream, just a dream, dream.
