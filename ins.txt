Convert raw recipes into structured html recipes.

Use "docs/p/recettes/pain_blanc_a_la_machine.html" as a template.

Convert all the files in the "wip" directory ("./docs/p/recettes/wip/").

Do not modify the instructions, but you can add them if they are missing.

Use fractions instead of decimals. Ex: 3 1/2 t instead of 3.5 t.
