F Dm A# F

[Verse]
F
 Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Dm
 Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
A#                                      F
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
     F
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Dm
 And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
A#                                          F
 But every time she asks me do I look okay I say

[Chorus]
                F                   Dm
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              A#                      F
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             F                      Dm
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  A#                       F
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are

[Verse]
F
 Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Dm
 Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
A#                                       F
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
         F
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Dm
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
A#                                                       F
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I say

[Chorus]
                F                   Dm
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              A#                      F
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             F                      Dm
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  A#                       F
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
            F                Dm
The way you are, the way you are
            A#                       F
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
                F                   Dm
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              A#                      F
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             F                      Dm
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  A#                       F
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
