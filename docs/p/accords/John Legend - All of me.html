[Intro]
Em  C  G  D  x2

[Verse 1]
Em           Cmaj7                  G
What would I do without your smart mouth
           D                      Em
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
          C            G               D          Em
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
             Cmaj7                 G
What's going on in that beautiful mind
                D             Em
I'm on your magical mystery ride
        Cadd9             G                     D         Amadd9
And I'm so   dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus A]
   Am             G
My head's under water
    D              Amadd9
But I'm breathing fine
                 G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you, oh

[Verse 2]
Em       C                       G
How many times do I have to tell you
                 D                       Em
Even when you're crying you’re beautiful too
              C           G          D                  Em
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
             C                 G
You're my downfall, you're my muse
             D                        Em
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                C             G        D            Am
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus A]
   Am             G
My head's under water
    D              Amadd9
But I'm breathing fine
                 G              D
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you, oh

[Pre-Chorus B]
Am         G
Cards on the table
       D             Amadd9
We're both showing hearts
Am       G                D
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
       G
Cause all of me
       Emadd9
Loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
           C/D        D
All your perfect imperfections
           G
Give your all to me
             Emadd9
I'll give my all to you
          Am/C
You're my end and my beginning
     C/D             D
Even when I lose I'm winning
                  Em   C      G   Dadd9
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    Dadd9
And you give me all, all of you

[Outro]
            Em   C      G   D
I give you all, all of me
                 Em   C      G    D
And you give me all, all of you, oh
