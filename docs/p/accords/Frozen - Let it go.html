      <h1>Frozen - Let it go</h1>
      <pre style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.25rem">[Verse]
    Fm                      C#
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D#              A#sus4  A#m
Not a footprint to be seen
  Fm            C#
A kingdom of isolation
       D#                 A#sus4   A#
And it looks like I'm the queen
Fm            C#                D#                A#sus4 A#m
  The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Fm                 D#                   A#
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
[Pre-Chorus]
D#                                C#
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D#
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C#
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
               C#add2
Well, now they know
[Chorus]
       G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
Can't hold it back anymore
          G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go 
      Fm7              C#add9
Turn away and slam the door
G#      D#sus4/G          Fm7      C#add9
I don't care what they're going to say
        Cm7         B
Let the storm rage on
    C#
The cold never bothered me anyway
[Instrumental]
G#  D#sus4/G
[Verse]
   Fm                    C#             D#              A#m
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Fm              D#                  A#sus4        A#
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
[Pre-Chorus]
D#                           C#add9
It's time to see what I can do
                             D# 
To test the limits and break through
                                 C#add9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    C#add2
I'm free
[Chorus]
       G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
I am one with the wind and sky
          G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7              C#add9
You'll never see me cry
G#      D#sus4/G          Fm7      C#add9
Here I stand and here I'll stay
        Cm7         B      C#
Let the storm rage on
[Bridge]
C#
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C#
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D#
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Fm        C#             D#              A#m    C#
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
[Chorus]
       G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7             C#add9
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
          G#         D#sus4/G
Let it go, let it go
      Fm7              C#add9
That perfect girl is gone
G#     D#sus4/G     Fm7      C#add9   C#m
Here I stand in the light of day
        Cm7         B      C#
Let the storm rage on
    C#
The cold never bothered me anyway
