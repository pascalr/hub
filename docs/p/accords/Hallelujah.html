C Am C Am
[Verse 1]
  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        C                  F           G
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift
    G            E7             Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
[Verse 2]
          C                        Am
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C            G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
C                   F       G
She tied you to her kitchen chair
    Am                        F
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    G                  E7            Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
[Verse 3]
C              Am
Baby I've been here before
     C                       Am
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  F             G             C          G
I used to live alone before I knew you
C                          F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am                    F
But love is not a victory march
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
[Verse 4]
     C                         Am
Well there was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What's really going on below
    F             G               C        G
But now you never show that to me do you
      C             F        G
But remember when I moved in you
        Am            F
And the holy dove was moving too
    G               E7            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
[Verse 5]
      C               Am
Well, maybe there's a god above
    C             Am
But all I've ever learned from love
    F                G           C          G
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
     C                  F       G
It's not a cry that you hear at night
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
[Outro]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
