[Intro]
Am G Am G
Am G Am G
Am G Am G
Am G Am G
Am G Am G

[Verse]
Am       G              Am      G        Am   G Am G
Now and then I think of when we were together
Am            G                Am      G         Am  G Am G
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Am      G                 Am        G   
Told myself that you were right for me
Am          G              Am     G
But felt so lonely in your company
Am           G                Am       G        Am   G Am G
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental]
Am G Am G
Am G Am G
Am G Am G
Am G Am G

[Verse 2]
Am            G           Am      G        Am    G Am G
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Am         G            Am
Like resignation to the end
G          Am  G Am G
Always the end
Am         G                   Am       G
So when we found that we could not make sense
Am       G                  Am         G
Well you said that we would still be friends
Am         G              Am        G       Am   G Am  G
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

[Chorus]
Am      G              F      G
But you didn't have to cut me off
Am       G             F
Make out like it never happened
         G          Am
And that we were nothing
    G            F         G
And I don't even need your love
        Am              G
But you treat me like a stranger
         F        G
And that feels so rough
Am   G               F      G
You didn't have to stoop so low
Am          G                  F
Have your friends collect your records
         G            Am
And then change your number
   G                 F         G
I guess that I don't need that though
Am                   G          F       G
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Am G F G
Am                   G          F       G
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Am G F G
Am                   G          F       G
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3]
Am G Am G 4x
Am      G               Am                   G        Am  G Am G      
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Am            G             F                G         Am  G Am G
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
G
And I don't wanna live that way
G
Reading into every word you say
G
You said that you could let it go
G
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

[Chorus]
Am      G              F      G
But you didn't have to cut me off
Am       G             F
Make out like it never happened
         G         Am
And that we were nothing
    G            F         G
And I don't even need your love
        Am              G
But you treat me like a stranger
         F        G
And that feels so rough
Am   G               F      G
You didn't have to stoop so low
Am          G                  F
Have your friends collect your records
         G            Am
And then change your number
   G                 F         G
I guess that I don't need that though
Am                   G          F       G
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Outro]
     Am G  F         G
Somebody (I used to know)
      Am                       G          F       G
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
     Am G  F         G
Somebody (I used to know)
      Am                       G          F       G
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Am  G    F       G
       I used to know
Am   G      F         G
       That I used to know
Am  G    F       G
       I used to know
      Am    G   F   G
Somebody...
