# The Sun

The next evolution of the Cloud. Instead of giving all your data and being dependant on big corporations on the Cloud, in the Sun everyone runs a Cloud at their home.

## Sun vs Cloud

Pros:
- Privacy
- Independant from companies closing or ending a product
- Independant from companies charging more for a service
- No vendor lock in, use any software you want to use

Cons:
- The user must buy and maintain the hardware and the software

## Sun vs Local

It's similar to Local vs Cloud

Pros:
- Access to your data from anywhere (through a VPN to connect to your home network)
- One source of truth for your data, your other devices contains backups only, no conflicts merging
- Just connect a new device and you have access to all your software and data

Cons:
- Needs internet connection

## Software

Maybe create a linux distribution?

See software folder for more choices.

- VPN (wireguard?, openVPN?)
