I am looking for FOSS to make a local Cloud. I am looking for something like Dropbox first.

If you want something FOSS and self-hosted that works like Dropbox for syncing files across devices, here are the best options:
1. Nextcloud

    What it is: The most popular open-source Dropbox alternative.

    Features:

        File sync across devices (desktop, mobile, web)

        Sharing links with password protection and expiry

        Calendar, contacts, notes, chat, and more via apps

    Pros: Huge community, lots of plugins, very stable.

    Cons: Can be heavier than minimal solutions.

2. Seafile

    What it is: A high-performance file syncing system with a Dropbox-like desktop client.

    Features:

        Faster sync for large libraries than Nextcloud

        Good version control for files

        Optional encryption per library

    Pros: Light, very efficient for large files.

    Cons: Smaller ecosystem than Nextcloud.

3. Syncthing (pure peer-to-peer)

    What it is: Direct device-to-device syncing with no central server.

    Features:

        All devices sync directly over LAN or internet

        Fully decentralized â€” no accounts needed

        Encrypted transfers

    Pros: Extremely lightweight, no server required if you just want sync.

    Cons: No web interface for browsing files like Dropbox â€” just sync.

4. ownCloud (older cousin of Nextcloud)

    What it is: The original project Nextcloud forked from.

    Features: Similar to Nextcloud, but with a slightly more corporate focus.

ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:

    If you want a full Dropbox-style interface + sharing, go Nextcloud or Seafile.

    If you want just fast sync without a central cloud, go Syncthing.

If you want, I can give you a comparison table with setup difficulty, performance, and resource usage so you can choose faster. That would make the decision much easier.
