[Intro]
F Dm C
[Verse 1]
F 
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
               C
Welcome to the final show
Hope you’re wearing your best clothes
F
You can't bribe the door
                   Dm
On your way to the sky
                C
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good...
[Pre-Chorus]
F
If we never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
F
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
[Chorus]
F 
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
              C
We gotta get away from here
              C7 
We gotta get away from here
F 
Just stop your crying
            Dm
It’ll be alright
                      C
They told me that the end is near
              C7 
We gotta get away from here
[Verse 2]
F 
Just stop your crying
                      Dm
Have the time of your life
                     C
Breakin' through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
F                             Dm
Remember everything will be alright
               C
We could meet again somewhere.
Somewhere far away from here. 
[Pre-Chorus]
F
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
F
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
[Chorus]
F 
Just stop your crying
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
             C
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
F 
Stop your crying, baby
            Dm
It’ll be alright
                      C
They told me that the end is near
              C7
We gotta get away from here
[Pre-Chorus]
F
If we never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
F
  We never learn we've been here before
Dm       
Why are we always stuck and
                   C
running from the bullets
       C7
The bullets...
[Bridge]
F
 We don't talk enough
Dm
  We should open up
C                        Bb
 Before it's all too much
F
 Will we ever learn
Dm
 We've been here before
C                       Bb
 It's just what we know
[Ending]
F 
Stop your crying, baby
                   Dm
It’s a sign of the times
             C
We gotta get away
               Bb           
We got to get away 
               F
We got to get away
               Dm
We got to get away
               C
We got to get away
We got to! We got to!
F
Away!
We got to! We got to!
Dm
Away!
We got to! We got to!
C       Bb
Awwwwaaaaaaay!
