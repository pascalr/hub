Capo: 5th fret

[Verse]
C
Give me a second I 
I need to get my story straight
     Am
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the empire state
     Dm
My lover she's waiting for me
Just across the bar
              F
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
G
Asking 'bout a scar
    C 
And I know I gave it to you months ago
Am
 I know you're trying to forget
       Dm
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
        F                          G
You know I'm trying hard to take it back

[Bridge]
              Dm      Em
So if by the time the bar closes
         Am        G       F
And you feel like falling down
       F       G
I'll carry you home

[Chorus]
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun

[Verse 2]
       C
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
  Am
I guess that I
                                                     Dm
I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
F                         G
 Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus]
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun

[Bridge]
 C                F
Carry me home tonight
     C/E              G
Just carry me home tonight
C               F
Carry me home tonight
      C               G
Just carry me home tonight
C                       F
The world is on my side  I have no reason to run
C/E                        G
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
C                        F
The angels never arrived  but I can hear the choir
C/E                       G
so will someone come and carry me home

[Chorus]
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun

[Bridge]
              Dm      Em
So if by the time the bar closes
         Am        G       F
And you feel like falling down
       F       G       C
I'll carry you home tonight
