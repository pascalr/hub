      <h1>How Far I'll Go</h1>
      <pre style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.25rem">[Verse 1]
E                                       F#m
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 C#m                           A
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
E                              F#m
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       C#m                           A
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
[Pre-Chorus 1] 
       C#m 
Every turn I take, every trail I track
       B
Every path I make, every road leads back
        E
To the place I know, where I cannot go
          Am
Though I long to be
[Chorus]
         E                                   B
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
            C#m               A
And no one knows, how far it goes
         E                                 B
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             C#m        Am
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
[Post-Chorus]
E                         B         
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
C#m                        A         
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
[Verse 2]
E                          F#m                             C#m   
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                   A
Everything is by design
E                          F#m                         C#m  
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
                          A
So maybe I can roll with mine
[Pre-Chorus 2]
       C#m                   
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
         B
I'll be satisfied if I play along
         E
But the voice inside sings a different song
         Am
What is wrong with me?
[Chorus 2]
         E                                   B
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
             C#m               A
But no one knows, how deep it goes
        E                                          B
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
            C#m           A
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
[Chorus 1]
         F                                     C
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
            Dm                A#
And no one knows, how far it goes
        F                                 C
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
              Dm                A#    
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
[Outro]
