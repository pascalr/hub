       D    G/B       A          D          G/B    A         D
You'll say, we've got nothing in common, no common ground to start from
       G/B      A     D     G/B     A
   and we're falling apart
       D        G/B       A      D             G/B        A      D
You'll say, the world has come between us, our lives have come between us
         G/B    A              D     G/B     A
   still I know you just don't care
[Chorus]
     D                A            G/B            D                A
And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's, she said I think I remember 
       G/B         D                   A            G/B           D       A
   the film and as I recall I think we both kind of liked it, and I said well that's
       A               G/B 
   the one thing we've got
[Solo]
D     G/B     A/C#     D     G/B     A
[Verse]
   D           G/B   A      D           G/B        A      D
I see you, the only one who knew me and now your eyes see through me 
G/B  A      D         G/B        A
   I guess I was wrong.
   D              G/B      A         D          G/B       A           D
So what now. it's plain to see we're over and I hate when things are over 
        G/B        A      D     G/B     A
   when so much is left undone
[Chorus]
