[Verse 1]
D/A           Gadd9                     A     Emadd9 Em 
  Where is the moment when we need it the most 
D/A                 Gadd9                  A   Emadd9 Em
  You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Bm                    A                    G 
  They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
                  D               Em
The tell me your passion's gone away
                              A  Em7 A
And I don't need no carrying on 

D/A             Gadd9                  A  Emadd9 Em
 Stand in line just to hit a new low.
D/A                 Gadd9                   A  Emadd9 Em 
  You're faking a smile with the coffee you go 
Bm                  A                   G 
  You tell me your life's been way off line 
                   D           Em 
You're falling to pieces everytime
                             A 
And I don't need no carrying on


[Chorus]
                     D
Cause you had a bad day 
                   G 
You're taking one down 
                Em                    A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
                    D 
You say you don't know 
                   G
You tell me don't lie
                Em                    A 
You work at a smile and you go for a ride 
               Bm 
You had a bad day
                  A
The camera don't lie
                    G                         D
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
               Em   A
You had a bad day
              D
You had a bad day

Bm                A          G
Well you need a blue sky holiday
                   D                 Em
The point is they laugh at what you say 
                             A
And I don't need no carrying on 


[Chorus]
                     D
Cause you had a bad day 
                   G 
You're taking one down 
                Em                    A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
                    D 
You say you don't know 
                   G
You tell me don't lie
                Em                    A 
You work at a smile and you go for a ride 
               Bm 
You had a bad day
                  A
The camera don't lie
                    G                         D
You're coming back down and you really don't mind 
               Em   A
You had a bad day 


[Bridge]
F
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
         Bb
And the whole thing it turns out wrong 
     F
You might not make it back and you know 
                Bb
That you could be well oh that strong 
D               G                  A  Emadd9 Em
Well I'm not wrong 

D                G                           A
So where is the passion when you need it the most 

Oh you and I 
D                G                       A
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 


[Final-Chorus]
                     D
Cause you had a bad day 
                   G 
You're taking one down 
                Em                    A
You sing a sad song just to turn it around 
                    D 
You say you don't know 
                   G
You tell me don't lie
                Em                    A 
You work at a smile and you go for a ride 
               Bm 
You had a bad day
                  Bb 
It seem what you like 
                D               E
And how does it feel for one more time 
               G   A
You had a bad day
              D  G  Em A  x4 (fade out)
had a bad day
