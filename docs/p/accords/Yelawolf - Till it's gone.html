[Intro]
Em
[Verse 1]
Em 
 I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on, now
I'm not the shoulder for a bag. The one that carried a heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when you looking for a short cut, uh
I ain't the stepping stone to be stepping on
I ain't nobodies crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money, man
You ain't looking at me
I'm not the cheap one, looking at me son
You ain't looking at free
I ain't the dish rag to come clean up all the shit that you dish out
Ain't got no check for em'
         C                                 Em
If you checking in, mothafucka, check this out
[Hook]
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
               Am                          Em
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
                  D                         C
And just because you got yourself in some shit
                           B             Em
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
                D                      C
You handle your own when you become a man
              Am                      Em
And become a man when you handle your own
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
                        B            Em
But what can I do if I do till it's gone? Oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh             
What can I do if I do till it's gone?
[Verse 2]
Em              
 I'm not the the trash can. Not the last man at the finish line, now
I'm not the new kid on the block that you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fucking needle in the hay stack that you finally found
This ain't no free rent
Come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside and just roll away clean
Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch
And the new truck that your scheming to check out
Unless your looking to check out 
               Em
What a mess now (come on)
[Hook]
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
               Am                          Em
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
                  D                         C
And just because you got yourself in some shit
                           B             Em
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
                D                      C
You handle your own when you become a man
              Am                      Em
And become a man when you handle your own
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
                        B            Em
But what can I do if I do till it's gone? Oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh
What can I do if I do till it's gone?
[Verse 3]
Em
 I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire. I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around me telling me I've changed
Damn, right I've fucking changed
When there's fucking change in my pocket hit the bucket
It was a rocking all a sudden
I went from shopping without nothing
To going shopping for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzing,
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
Hip hop, you gotta love it
[Hook]
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
               Am                          Em
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
                  D                         C
And just because you got yourself in some shit
                           B             Em
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
                D                      C
You handle your own when you become a man
              Am                      Em
And become a man when you handle your own
                  D                   C
Ain't much I can do, but I do what I can
                        B            Em
But what can I do if I do till it's gone? Oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
           Em
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh, oh
Till it's gone, oh
What can I do if I do till it's gone?
