[Intro]
Am  F  C  Em
[Verse]
Am
Oh, the wind whistles down
F
The cold dark street tonight
          C                             Em
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
          Am
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
F
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
          C
And the songs they get louder
                       Em
Each one better than before
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight
                         Am
Where you gonna sleep tonight
[Instrumental]
(Am)  F  C  Em
[Verse]
           Am
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
            F
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
     C                                   Em
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
           Am
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
          F
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
      C                                                   Em
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                         Am
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
[Instrumental]
(Am)  F  C  Em
 Am   F  C  Em
[Chorus]
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                        Am
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         F
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   C
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Em
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                         Am
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
