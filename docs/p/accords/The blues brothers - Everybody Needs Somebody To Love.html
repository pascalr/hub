[Intro]
C F Bb F
Were so glad to see so many of you lovely people here
tonight, and we would especially like
to welcome all the representatives of Illinois'
law enforcement community who have chosen to
join us here in the palace hotel ballroom at this
time. We certainly hope you all enjoy the 
show, and remember people, that no matter who you
are and what you do to live, thrive and 
survive, there're still some things that make us
all the same. You, me, them, everybody, everybody.

[Verse]
C F Bb F
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love (someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (sugar to kiss)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you in the morning
I need you, you, you when my soul's on fire

[Chorus]
Am
Sometimes I feel
F
I feel a little sad inside
Am
When my baby mistreats me
    G
I never, never, never have a place to hide
             C
I need you

[Mellemspil]
| C | F |

[Chorus]
Am
Sometimes I feel
F
I feel a little sad inside
Am
When my baby mistreats me
    G
I never, never, never have a place to hide
             C
I need you

[Bridge]
C F Bb F   Break
You know people, when you do find that special somebody
You gotta hold that man, hold that woman
Love him, please him, squeeze her, please her
Signify your feelings with every gentle caress
Because it's so important to have that special somebody
To hold, to kiss, to miss, to squeeze and please

[Verse]
C F Bb F
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love
Sweetheart to miss
Sugar to kiss
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you...
