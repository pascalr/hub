Dm      F       x4
[Verse 1]
Dm
Weep for yourself, my man,
                               F
you'll never be what is in your heart.
Dm
Weep little lion man,
                                       F
you're not as brave as you were at the start.
C
Rate yourself and rake yourself,
A#           A#maj7           F
take all the courage you have left.
C
Wasted on fixing all the
A#               A#maj7            F
problems that you made in your own head.
[Chorus]
         Dm          A#         F
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Dm         A#        F
and it was your heart on the line.
         Dm        A#       F
I really fucked it up this time,
             C
didn't I, my dear?
                  Dm
Didn't I, my dear?
Dm    F
Dm    F
[Verse 2]
Dm
Tremble for yourself my man,
                                       F
you know that you have seen this all before.
Dm
Tremble little lion man,
                                F
you'll never settle any of your scores.
C
Your grace is wasted in your face,
     A#              A#maj7           F
your boldness stands alone among the wreck.
C
Learn from your mother or else
A#              A#maj7           F
spend your days biting your own neck.
[Chorus]
         Dm          A#         F
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Dm         A#        F
and it was your heart on the line.
         Dm        A#       F
I really fucked it up this time,
             C
didn't I, my dear?
         Dm          A#         F
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Dm         A#        F
and it was your heart on the line.
         Dm        A#       F
I really fucked it up this time,
             C
didn't I, my dear?
                  Dm
Didn't I, my dear?
Dm    F

[Bridge]
C     F      A#      x8
[Chorus]
         Dm                    F
But it was not your fault but mine,
         Dm         A#        F
and it was your heart on the line.
         Dm        A#       F
I really fucked it up this time,
             C
didn't I, my dear?
         Dm (Mute)
But it was not your fault but mine,
and it was your heart on the line.
I really fucked it up this time,
didn't I, my dear?
                 F
Didn't I, my dear?
