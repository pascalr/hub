Am - F - C - G

[Chorus]
Am        F              C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am    F
Separate my side
C        G                 Am    F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
C                   G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

[Verse 1]
Am                         Em
I heard your voice through a photograph
Am                           Em
I thought it up and brought up the past
Am                          Em
Once you know you can never go back
G                       A*
I've got to take it on the otherside

[Verse 2]
Am                    Em
Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                  Em
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                     Em
Stranger things never change my mind
G                       A
I've got to take it on the otherside
G           A
Take it on the otherside
G*
Take it on
A*
Take it on

[Chorus]
Am        F              C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am    F
Separate my side
C        G                 Am    F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
C                   G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

[Verse 3]
Am                  Em
Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                         Em
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
Am                    Em
She wants to know am I still a slut
G                       A**
I've got to take it on the otherside

[Verse 4]
Am                   Em
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
Am                  Em
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Am                   Em
Push the trigger and pull the thread
G                       A
I've got to take it on the otherside
G           A
Take it on the otherside
G*
Take it on
A*
Take it on

[Chorus]
Am        F              C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am    F
Separate my side
C        G                 Am    F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
C                   G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

[Instrumental]
Em* - C*
Em* - C*

[Bridge]
Em*
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C*
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
Em*
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
C*
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again
[Instrumental]
Am - F - C - G

[Chorus]
Am        F              C
 How long, how long will I slide?
G            Am    F
Separate my side
C        G                 Am    F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
C                   G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
Am  F      C        G             Am    F
How long  I don't, don't believe it's bad
C
Slit my throat
G
it's all I ever
Am (one strum down)
